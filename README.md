One of the best puzzle or problem in which a larger disc can not be moved on top of smaller disc and to find the recursive solution to move disc from left to right or from right to left recursively. For three disc to do so we move the smaller disc(1) to left, second disc(2) to the right,first disc(1) to the left,largest disc(3) to the left,first disc i.e smallest disc(1) to the left,second disc to the right and first disc to the left.
For three disc it took 7 steps which is 2^3 -1 steps.
For n disc it will take 2^n-1 steps.
For n=64 it will take 5.85 billion centuries to arrive at the end result.
Interesting fact it is said that if for n=64 when the program arrives at the end the world will end.
2^64-1 is a huge number. Even if your machine/system can execute billions of instructions per second then to arrive at the end of the program it will take 5.84 centuries approx.
So the world is not going to end for a while.
Take a pen and paper and solve this for three disc to understand it more accurately.
